	  impossible to replace selected text with text from clipboard"
	  > Rev5185 "* copy/cut-paste fixes in linux"
	  
	  > The reason for the revert is that calling wxClipboard methods
	  causes the
	  event loop to be executed on wxgtk. For wx3.x there is some event
	  filtering
	  that happens to the processed events and it seems that windowing
	  events get
	  filtered. This breaks the redraw of windows on ubuntu when a
	  modal dialog
	  is shown. In rev 9420 we've added clipboard handling from the app
	  activated
	  event in order to fix a problem with copy/paste problems on
	  linux. But this
	  was another work-around on top of two workarounds. It seems that

	  > This revert will disable middle clip pasting on all platforms,

	  guidelines as

	  > See the next commit for the restoration of the middle click

svn10902:  * CCTest: automatically test for doxygen document.
	  (thanks White-Tiger)
	  
	  This is SF ticket 232:
	  
	  Here is the note from White-Tiger
	  1) I've also fixed some trimming while I was at it.
	  (wxString::Trim(bool trim_right) defaults to true and cctest did
	  two
	  Trim().. one with default true and one with implicit true)
	  2) the code inside the constructor isn't required since it's
	  usually
	  the default anyway... but maybe do it implicit nontheless
	  3) the patch to src/plugins/codecompletion/parser/parser_base.cpp
	  should be properly redone, or at least every use of it verified
	  since it'll probably always default to storeDocumentation = true
	  even
	  in situations where it "shouldn't"
	  4) the last "test" should fail... there are 2 special test values
	  for
	  doxygen comments, "*" as a "non-empty" wildcard, and "-" to check
	  for
	  empty docs
	  
	  Also, some fixes from my(olldbg) side
	  1, enable the store doxygen doc option for the parser in cctest.
	  2, fix a bug in the the cctest's parser, we should firstly mark
	  the file
	  in the TokenTree, so that the doxygen document will bestored in
	  the
	  Token::m_Doc, otherwise, it was wrongly stored in the m_ImpDoc.
	  See
	  Token* ParserThread::DoAddToken() about how the doxygen document
	  are added
	  to the Token.

	  When parsing
	  struct AAA a1 = {.x = 1, .y=2}; // first line
	  struct AAA a2 = {.x = 1, .y=2}; // second line
	  When we see a "dot", we need to skip to "}", thus the close brace
	  is
	  skipped, and the open brace is just start a function call of
	  DoParse().
	  If we goes to the second line, we will call another DoParse(), so
	  there
	  is recursive calls, and finally goes to crash.

	  {
	  class vector
	  {
	  size_t size();
	  }
	  }
	  Where the _GLIBCXX_PSEUDO_VISIBILITY is not defined, we need to
	  skip the whole
	  content after the "std", and before "{".
	  The solution is that we checks which token is skipped by the
	  SkipToOneOfChars
	  function. If it is the "{", then we need to still recognize it as
	  the
	  beginning of the namespace body.
	  
	  A test case is also added.

	  int value2 = 0;
	  
	  // hover on "value1"
	  if (!value1) {}

	  if (value1 && value2) {}
	  
	  // Above tooltips will be shown correctly because the statements
	  // within if(...), do(...), etc are NOT parsed entirely.
	  // Revision 10230 "fixes" this problem, but now, parsing these
	  statements
	  // introduces the following regression.
	  //if (!value1) {} // adds a new token "! value1"
	  //if (value1 && value2){} // adds a new token "value1&& value2"
	  }
	  Also, a new cctest case file is added.
	  Note that currently our CCTest system can only test code
	  completion in global mode

	  executed.

svn10494:  * CC: fix bug #16 remove the __attribute__(xxx) in
	  function arguments
	  
	  We have those code snippet:
	  In header file:
	  void CodeCompletion::OnFindReferences(wxCommandEvent& event)
	  In implementation file:
	  void CodeCompletion::OnFindReferences(cb_unused wxCommandEvent&
	  event)
	  
	  Now, the cb_unused is expanded to __attribute__(__unused__)
	  Thus, those two function tokens can't be merged together since
	  their
	  compact function parameters are different.
	  We fix this issue by removing the __attribute__(...) in
	  ParserThread::GetBaseArgs() function.
	  See:
	  http://sourceforge.net/p/codeblocks/tickets/16/
	  Note that ParserThread::GetBaseArgs() function still has many
	  issues
	  need to be fixed.

svn10454:  * CC: when expanding function like macros, the actual
	  parameter doesn't exists, thus the expansion failed, we need to
	  reset the m_Lex, so that the caller don't get wrong token. Here
	  is an example:
	  
	  /**
	  * Command to setup an exception breakpoint (for a throw or a
	  catch).
	  */
	  class GdbCmd_SetCatch : public DebuggerCmd
	  {
	  wxString m_type;
	  int *m_resultIndex;
	  wxRegEx m_regExp;
	  public:
	  GdbCmd_SetCatch(DebuggerDriver *driver, const wxString &type, int
	  *resultIndex) :
	  DebuggerCmd(driver),
	  m_type(type),
	  m_resultIndex(resultIndex),
	  m_regExp(wxT("^Catchpoint[ \\t]([0-9]+)[ \\t]\\(") + type +
	  wxT("\\)$"), wxRE_ADVANCED)
	  {
	  m_Cmd = wxT("catch ") + type;
	  }
	  
	  void ParseOutput(const wxString& output)
	  {
	  if (m_regExp.Matches(output))
	  {
	  long index;
	  m_regExp.GetMatch(output, 1).ToLong(&index);
	  *m_resultIndex = index;
	  }
	  }
	  };

	  - open many editors
	  - drag and drop editors in multiple tab controls - one tab ctrl

	  In the old version these commands will close all editors, but I

	  the tab
	  control of the current editor.

	  We just skip the problematic token which causes infinite loop

	  ReplaceBufferText()
	  function. In the function
	  
	  void Tokenizer::GetReplacedToken(wxString& str)
	  {
	  // this indicates we are already in macro replacement mode
	  if (m_RepeatReplaceCount > 0)
	  {
	  const int id = m_TokenTree->TokenExists(str, -1, tkMacroDef);
	  if (id != -1)
	  {
	  const Token* token = m_TokenTree->at(id);
	  if (token)
	  {
	  bool replaced = false;
	  if (!token->m_Args.IsEmpty())
	  replaced = ReplaceMacroUsage(token);
	  else if (token->m_FullType != token->m_Name)
	  replaced = ReplaceBufferText(token->m_FullType);
	  
	  if (replaced || token->m_FullType.IsEmpty())
	  {
	  SkipUnwanted();
	  // recursive call the DoGetToken function here
	  str = DoGetToken();
	  }
	  }
	  }
	  // if in macro expansion mode, we don't want to let the user
	  replacement rule executed
	  // again, so just returned
	  return;
	  }
	  
	  When replaced = ReplaceBufferText(token->m_FullType);
	  The replaced is now true, so it satisfies the if condition, and a
	  further
	  str = DoGetToken(); function call just skip the problematic
	  token.

svn10131:  * CC: do not save the macro usage tokens in the token

	  macro usage is just like a function call, if we save all macro
	  usages, our
	  token tree becomes too large. E.g. with this patch, the token
	  number is
	  reduced from about 15000 to 13000 when parsing codeblocks.cbp.
	  The only
	  case we need to save the macro usage are some special macro
	  usages like
	  BEGIN_EVENT_TABLE or EVT_BUTTON, but this needs futures works. To
	  many
	  macro call tokens of the same name also pollute the tooltip.

svn10107:  * FileManager: adds support for viewing diffs and
	  browsing the history of a version controlled folder (currently

	  The feature is experimental so it's disabled by default and
	  probably has lots
	  of bugs. To enable it right click on a file/folder in the Files
	  tab of the
	  Management pane and Select Settings -> [VCS] Integration. Then
	  for folders that
	  are under that VCS's management, you should see a VCS choice box.
	  Note that
	  when you select a particular commit using the choice box you are
	  NOT checking
	  out that commit so the content of the folder won't be changed.
	  You can
	  easily flip back to viewing the folder content itself by
	  selecting "working copy".
	  While browsing a commit or the working copy in the file manager,
	  you should
	  be able to view files and see diffs using the right click menu.
	  Also note that
	  performance usually stinks for SVN because of network
	  performance.

svn9991:  * CC: fix a bug that CodeCompletion's setting don't get
	  saved when C::B closed.
	  
	  To reproduce the bug, you can
	  1, start C::B (without opening any cbp project)
	  2, open the codecompletion's setting dialog
	  3, change some settings, such as: Options - Disable SmartSense
	  4, close the setting dialog and close C::B
	  5, reopen C::B, run step 2 again, you will notice the setting is
	  not saved yet.
	  
	  The bug was cause by the commit rev9920, there I changed the
	  ReadOptions() and WriteOptions() functions to virtual functions,
	  also the implementation of those functions in ParserBase class
	  are empty, the derived Parser class has real implementations(read
	  and write the configure file). But NativeParser::NativeParser()
	  create a ParserBase instance not a Parser instance, and
	  ParserBase::ReadOptions() and ParserBase::WriteOptions() do
	  nothing.
	  
	  To avoid the ParserBase to read the configure file (that's what
	  rev9920 want to achieve), I let the NativeParser create a real
	  Parser instance (not ParserBase), thus this commit partially
	  revert the code refactoring at rev7336 (2011-8-8, by Loaden).

	  If you have a test file, e.g. testing/a.cpp, the former way was
	  load the file to wxScintilla control, when start parsing, we
	  first save the contents of wxScintilla control to a temporary
	  file, then parse it, and finally delete the temporary file. With
	  this commit, we don't need to use temporary files, the file can
	  be parsed directly if a file name is specified. The ParserBase
	  class can directly load the file from hard disk for parsing.

svn9951:  * CC: fix bug when handling "##" operator in macro
	  expansion.
	  
	  When debugging with cctest without any user replace rules (enable
	  macro expansion check on every token), I found that the
	  surrounding spaces of "##" don't get removed. For example, when
	  parsing C++'s basic_string.h, the namespace std can't recognized
	  correctly due to wrongly expanding
	  "_GLIBCXX_VISIBILITY(default)".
	  I create a simple test code here:
	  
	  namespace std _GLIBCXX_VISIBILITY(default)
	  {
	  class string { };
	  }
	  
	  Here the _GLIBCXX_VISIBILITY(default) should finally be replaced
	  to an empty token, but if surrounding spaces are not removed, we
	  will get a sequence like: "_GLIBCXX_PSEUDO_VISIBILITY_" and
	  "default". This commit fixes such issue.

svn9932:  * CC: Apply patch by Huki, which merges function

	  http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,19278.msg134227.html#msg134227.
	  
	  The patch fixes handling the function pointer declaration pattern
	  like: unsigned int (*AAA) (float BBB);
	  The normal function declaration and function pointer declaration
	  are handled in the same way in the DoParse().
	  The patch also enable checking each lexeme like token for macro
	  usage, thus many cctest cases like:
	  testing/cc_x_macro.cpp and
	  testing/cc_function_ptr_com_interface.cpp get 100% passes. The
	  only drawback
	  is that the parsing time becomes a little longer, but we can get
	  more precise parsing results especially in codes
	  with many macro usages.

	  calls (there were just a few of them, and all of them in

	  ReplaceBufferText(). So it's safe to remove this parameter.

svn9916:  * CC: Apply patch by Huki, this improved parsing

	  Both the four patterns of the function/variable will be
	  recognized:
	  void(*foo)(int a); // func ptr
	  void *(*foo)(int a); // func ptr with ptr return type
	  void foo(int a); // function decl
	  AAA foo(5); // var initialized with ctor (only supported for
	  local block)
	  
	  For the Pattern "AAA BBB(...);", we need to distinguish the token
	  type by where the statement locates, if it locates in a local
	  block, such as a function body, we recognize it as a variable
	  named BBB with type AAA, otherwise, it is a function declaration.
	  This is just a hack since our parser don't use semantic checking.

	  ->NativeParser::CreateParser for the active project
	  ->new Parser

	  ParserThreadedTask is executed
	  ->parse the macro definition
	  ->new ParserThread for each file in file list
	  ->put ParserThread in task pool queue
	  
	  Thread pool finish running tasks:
	  ->do one of below

	  *CASE2: if file list is not empty, kick the batch timer
	  *CASE3: if macro definition is not empty, kick the batch timer
	  *CASE4: non of the above cases, send Parse Finish Event!
	  
	  In this commit, we don't need to copy the ParserThread to task
	  pool queue, and later to thread pool, we can directly put the

	  - Also don't display the tilde in "symbol not found" messages
	  after go to decl / impl (i.e., don't prepend ~ to "target"
	  string).
	  - If the tilde prefix is there, first look for a class destructor
	  as usual but if one is not found, fallback to accept any
	  variable.

	  Parser::Parse(const wxString& filename, bool isLocal, bool
	  locked, LoaderBase* loader) function a lot, if the header file is

	  immedially when Parser::Parse() is called. The related discussion

	  and pass testing counts. If the user need to see the full parser
	  log messages, they should define them, which will plot a log of
	  log messages.
	  3, redirect the wxLogMessage to the text ctrl of the frame.
	  4, fix typo in comments, and add some comments.
	  5, project target setting change, make it a gui app instead of

svn9438:  * CC: fix bug ##19186,
	  http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=19186&group_id=5358,
	  when a file was re-parsed, the Token name for the unnamed struct
	  always changed, this is because we use a global counter for all
	  the unnamed struct/enum. Solution: let these counters file
	  related, which means each file have its own counter staring from
	  zero, and the Token name has a file index prefix like
	  __UnnamedStruct70, where 7 is refer to a file index, the 0
	  donates the unnamed struct counter. Also, the counter is started
	  from 0, it was 1 before. Reparse does not change the file index,
	  so we will not produce garbage token names.

	  many differences come from autogeneration of the source files

svn9299:  * debugger: Improve GetEditorWordAtCaret to work
	  correctly for non-rectangle selections (thanks Huki)
	  
	  The old code makes a rectangle from the start of the selection to
	  the end of
	  it. And it the selection is multiline and non-rectangular this
	  code won't
	  return the proper string when the mouse pointer is outside the
	  rectangle,
	  but still over the selected text. The new version uses one of
	  Scintilla
	  functions to do it simpler and properly.

	  2. Add a new method in the cbDebuggerPlugin class that allows
	  C::B to ask

	  1. Add new kind of watches that are not user controlled/created,
	  but are
	  controlled by the plugin (lots more polish is needed for this
	  feature).
	  2. Modify the plugin to create two special watches one for locals
	  and one
	  for arguments. Modify drivers accordingly (CDB does nothing).
	  3. Implement new command that parses locals or arguments and
	  fills the
	  special watches. Add code for parsing the format.
	  4. Add tests for the parser code.
	  5. Enable the options for locals and arguments in the settings.

2012-11-10 18:37  thomasdenk

	  on start-up of C::B
	  * print what compilers cause auto-detection to be shone in the

2012-11-09 13:02  thomasdenk

svn8536:  - Added 'unused' and 'optional' (alias of unused)
	  attribute macros
	  - Changed all attributes to double-underscore versions to be on
	  the safe side (name conflicts)

	  'must_consume_result'
	  - Changed sdk_events and filemanager accordingly to reflect
	  changes

2012-11-09 12:46  mortenmacfly

svn8535:  * adjust the size of an old window session to current
	  display on start-up
	  * this may interfere with restoring position on a multi-monitor
	  system on start-up, but is essential so the main window is not
	  out of screen after startup (happens i.e. with portable C::B when
	  saving the settings on a multi-monitor system and then opening
	  C::B on a single-monitor system again)

svn7954:  * Improved the UI for the first time C::B is started
	  and there is no default.conf file:
	  - Made the script console to be hidden by default;
	  - Added new method in the cbPlugin used to ask the priority of
	  the created toolbar, the default is 50;
	  - Changed the priority for the compiler and cc plugins to 1 and
	  10 respectively;
	  - Refactored the toolbar creation code - now when the plugins are
	  loaded during the c::b's startup,
	  no toolbars are created, but the toolbars are created at the end
	  after all plugins have been loaded.
	  This makes it possible to sort toolbars by priority and to
	  optimize the layout (the old code created
	  every toolbar on new row, which was pretty ugly);
	  - Made the initial windows size a bit larger and used wxDisplay
	  to ask for the full size of the
	  desktop (not reliable on linux with enlightenment dr17 running);
	  - Made the tips of the day to not show by default and added a
	  link to them on the start here page;

2011-06-13 11:13  loaden

svn7220:  * Remove all memory pool reference, In currently,
	  memory pool is not thread-safe
	  - At least in Linux 64bit can avoid a crash when quit CB
	  sometimes.
	  - I can't find any reason to keep a memory pool here.

2011-06-13 10:04  mortenmacfly

	  scripting: EnvvarGetEnvvarSetNames, EnvvarGetActiveSetName,

	  - note: you'll need to enter "file types and masks" from the
	  project tree one time and apply the settings with OK for a
	  clean-up

	  Cygwin and MinGW compiler)
	  * this is a workaround for the fact that windres cannot handle
	  include path switches with spaces in the path correctly even if
	  they are quoted
	  - some code-cleanup in compiler plugin

2011-06-12 09:42  mortenmacfly

svn7208:  * projectmanager: do not rebuild the tree if app is
	  shutting down (not needed and massively saves time on shutdown)

	  keeps chunks of code currently crated and some other stuff
	  required while code generation
	  * Improved generation of header files - including PCH filter
	  support and forward declarations (not yet fully enabled but works
	  perfectly while testing)

	  anywhere

	  one font enumerator and one array of faces

	  wxsItem::IsRootItem instead of wxsItem::GetParent (make code more
	  stable and extensible)

2007-01-27 00:25  daniel2000

svn3543:  - little fix in autorevision (in revision comparison
	  with existing autorevision.h)

	  option added :
	  - is an advanced compiler option
	  - default is false (means use relative paths) (this is the

svn3469:  * Scripting updates:
	  - GetScriptingManager().RegisterScriptMenu() signature changed
	  from (scriptFile, menuPath) to (menuPath, scriptFileOrFunction,
	  (bool)isFunction). This allows registering a script-function
	  (instead of a full script) to a menu. Useful, for example, to
	  create a single script with various functions and bind them all
	  to menus.
	  - Added IO.GetCwd() and IO.SetCwd() to get/set the working
	  directory.
	  - Added ProgressDialog script class. Use its single member
	  function Update(value, message) to update it. Value must always
	  lie in the 0-100 range.
	  - Added ShowDialog(xrcFile, dlgName, callbackFunc) function to
	  load and display a dialog from XRC. The callbackFunc is a script
	  function you define to handle all click-events. While in a
	  ShowDialog() call, there are also the EndModal(retCode) and
	  XRCID(controlName) functions available.
	  - Wiki docs soon to be updated.
	  * Main project file (windows) updated to new format.

2007-01-10 09:21  killerbot

svn3468:  * UseFlatObjects setting now also saved in the conf
	  - header cleanup/fixes

svn3460:  * added support for flat objects usage :
	  - "compiler" switch : Advanced compiler options : Other :
	  UseFlatObjects
	  - the object file will be create directly under the object output
	  dir, no subdirs reflecting the source tree
	  * compiler switches structure now has constructor : several
	  switches never got initialized in the different compilers

2007-01-04 15:02  mandrav

svn3459:  - Bug-fix for object names generation in multi-compiler
	  projects.

2007-01-04 13:47  mandrav

svn3458:  * Added per-project notes (accessible through project
	  properties or menu "Project->Notes"). There is also the option to
	  display the project's notes on-load (useful if you want to share
	  your project with others and want to embed some usage/setup
	  instructions, for example).
	  * New project option for generating object filenames. Currently
	  C::B generates a file's filename by replacing its extension with
	  the object extension (e.g. foo.cpp ->foo.o). This option allows
	  you instead to append the object extension (e.g. foo.cpp ->
	  foo.cpp.o). Useful for projects with compileable files having the
	  same name (and in the same directory) but different extensions.
	  * Added new generic dialog containing a multiline text box
	  (read-only or editable; controlled by the constructor). Used for
	  project notes currently.
	  * Project file version upgraded to 1.6. Differences from 1.5
	  include changes to accommodate the above new features plus that
	  now only values that differ from the defaults are saved (so
	  project files are smaller now).
	  * SDK version pumped to 1.11.6.
	  - Script bindings updates for the new cbProject methods.
	  - Minor fix in annoying dialog: left-top alignment for icon.

2007-01-04 13:35  mandrav

svn3457:  * Code-completion:
	  - bug-fix for duplicate C/C++ parser dirs per-project.

	  parsed.
	  - Re-organized code-completion's options.
	  - Added option to disable the symbols browser (separately from

	  * The watches tree is currently disabled for the CDB debugger
	  (until the relevant code is rewritten).

2006-09-28 09:43  mandrav

svn2997:  * Fixed bug that recently crept in C::B plugin wizard.

2006-09-28 08:38  mandrav

2006-09-21 19:13  mandrav

svn2987:  * Fixed autotools build (added missing $DESTDIR).

2006-09-20 21:08  mandrav

2006-09-20 14:16  killerbot

svn2985:  * Check also for modified projects when the app get's
	  (re)activated, so that externally modified project files (.cbp)
	  allow the user to reload them (just like with externally modified
	  files)

2006-09-20 13:08  mandrav

svn2984:  * Added options for build targets to auto-generate the
	  output filename, based on the running platform. This should bring
	  us closer to the final goal of one project file for all
	  platforms.

2006-09-20 13:05  mandrav

svn2983:  * Plugin loading redesigned
	  - All plugins must provide a resource zip file containing at
	  least one file named manifest.xml. Several hard-coded things in a
	  plugin have moved to this manifest file (and more to come).
	  - Got rid of the ugly macros for registering a plugin. Replaced
	  by a templated class.
	  - All plugins in our repository have been updated accordingly.

2006-09-13 13:42  mandrav

svn2975:  * Fixed symbols browser flickering/pause on update (for
	  large projects/workspaces).

	  last run, even if maximized.

2006-09-13 13:07  mandrav

	  should delete the current layout and it will be fixed.

2006-09-12 14:00  tiwag

svn2972:  - ANSI-build header bug fixed : wxUSE_UNICODE is always
	  defined
	  check with #ifdef wxUSE_UNICODE is not sufficient, use always #if
	  wxUSE_UNICODE

2006-09-11 14:06  pecan

svn2971:  * DragScroll v0.28 Re: Config fonts too small on some
	  Linux systems
	  - Removed all SetFont() calls
	  - Removeed SetBackgroundColor() calls

2006-09-11 10:45  tiwag

svn2970:  - ANSI BUILD patchfile for CB-projectfiles added

2006-09-11 10:12  tiwag

svn2969:  - changed linker libs to be ansi-build compliant (works
	  on XP too)

2006-09-10 21:47  mandrav

svn2968:  * Fixed issue with debugger breakpoints not actually
	  being removed (although it seemed like they were). The issue
	  existed only for pending breakpoints (i.e. breakpoints resolved
	  at runtime, e.g. inside a shared library).

2006-09-10 08:36  mandrav

svn2967:  * Improvements in code-completion parsing.
	  * Typedefs parsing in code-completion is back again.

2006-09-09 21:18  byo

svn2966:  New wxSmith: (please do not test new wxSmith, it's not
	  usable in this commit)
	  * Started implementing wxSmith in more layered style, wxSmith
	  currently contain project integration layer (independent of gui
	  or resource types)
	  * Added wxsGUI / wxsGUIFactory classes
	  * Moved wxsResourceTreeData to separate files / renamed to
	  wxsResourceTreeItemData

2006-09-09 15:09  mandrav

svn2965:  * Disabled last changes in the encoding detector as it
	  is deemed "incomplete".

2006-09-08 23:32  killerbot

svn2964:  - comment out a DBGLOG (will not compile if no pch)
	  NOTE: gdb_tipwindow is not really include correct in case of non
	  pch

2006-09-08 12:28  mandrav

svn2963:  * Fixed bug with saving UTF16 files (since last
	  encoding-related commit). Please be *really* careful with this
	  feature. It still is *not* solid, so avoid editing files for
	  which you have no backup available.

2006-09-08 11:02  mandrav

svn2962:  * Avoid duplicate entries when code-completing
	  #includes (bug #8692).

2006-09-08 10:50  mandrav

svn2961:  * When creating a new empty file, the user is asked to
	  add it in the active project (old behaviour re-instated).

2006-09-08 10:32  mandrav

svn2960:  * Improved the document encoding detector.

2006-09-08 06:14  killerbot

	  function, function choice control should not have a selection

2006-09-04 18:46  mandrav

svn2953:  - Fixed build error.

2006-09-04 17:41  mandrav

svn2952:  - Fixed compile error for non-windows platforms.

2006-09-04 16:50  mandrav

svn2951:  * Fixed wrong appearence of images under pre-XP windows
	  versions. - For the above to work, the global function
	  cbLoadBitmap() was added and every developer is encouraged to use
	  this whenever a bitmap must be loaded from disk. I have already
	  converted everything in the code to use this.

2006-09-04 13:12  mandrav

svn2950:  * Fixed display bug of debugger's tooltips, in rare
	  cases (bug #8604).

2006-09-04 12:47  mandrav

svn2949:  * When closing a project, remove all of its breakpoints
	  from the debugger.

2006-09-04 11:13  mandrav

svn2948:  * Fixed small bug with toolbar sizes (in XP this time,
	  doh).

2006-09-03 20:41  mortenmacfly

svn2947:  - SDK documentation update (fixed doxygen warnings)

2006-09-03 12:46  mandrav

	  project files for
	  linux.

2006-09-03 12:45  mandrav

	  browser.

2006-09-02 21:49  pecan

svn2944:  * cbKeyBinder v0.4.25d
	  - record dynamically changed menu items
	  - Get menu shortcuts via wxAcceratorEntry to appease wxGTK
	  - Add file name to corrupted file message
	  - Non Destructive update of menu items
	  - backup of .ini file to .ini.bak before delete/save

2006-09-02 19:36  killerbot

svn2943:  - this is what happens when you press ctrl-s and the
	  ctrl didn't make it through

2006-09-02 19:29  killerbot

svn2942:  - insertclassmethoddlg : little include fix

2006-09-02 10:47  killerbot

svn2941:  * autodetect compilers : allow only 1 selection for
	  default Compiler
	  - little include cleanup

2006-09-02 09:19  mandrav

svn2940:  * Removed the environment option to enabling the
	  toolbar hack for XP. It is now completely auto-detected if the
	  hack is needed, for all Windows versions.

2006-09-02 08:13  mandrav

svn2939:  - Removed sdk dependency on libwxscintilla.a in project
	  file. Not needed since libwxscintilla.a is a dll import lib.
	  * Fixed a couple of issues when updating the symbols browser.
	  * Added "All class methods without implementation" in editor's
	  context menu ("Insert" submenu). This revealed a bug in the
	  parser, regarding return values with namespaces. So expect it to
	  output code that doesn't compile in these cases (until the parser
	  bug is fixed).
	  * Fixed bad flickering caused the moment the code-completion list
	  was shown. This was caused by a hack in wxScintilla. The
	  side-effect is that the selected word in the list is highlighted
	  in gray instead of blue (standard colors) but this shouldn't be
	  too much of a problem.

2006-09-02 07:56  mandrav

svn2938:  * Added hack to fix toolbar sizes for toolbars that
	  contain windows controls. This hack is automatically applied on
	  all Windows versions prior to XP. An environment option has been
	  added to enable this hack for XP too. This is needed only if you
	  run C::B *without* a manifest file in XP.

2006-08-31 16:33  tiwag

svn2936:  * batchbuild log window auto-closes even when an error
	  occurred during the build,
	  if the option --no-batch-window-close was not given.
	  - Info: a non-zero build-error-code is returned as exit-code when
	  batchbuilding and
	  can be handled by the calling batch-script

2006-08-31 14:34  tiwag

svn2935:  * compilergcc - "Abort Build" : for WXMSW only : write
	  logmessage before skipping the rest of the logstream,
	  it can take a while, until gcc stops the actual build. no change
	  for Linux build.

2006-08-31 14:15  tiwag

svn2934:  * Build options -> "Project/Target change with changed
	  settings" dialog changed to AnnoyingDialog

2006-08-31 12:48  mandrav

svn2933:  - Fix for out-of-place autotools builds.

	  definition
	  __WXDEBUG__ when the wx debug-libraries are selected

svn2930:  * Fixed (improved) "current file's symbols" symbols
	  browser's view filter.

2006-08-31 10:19  mandrav

svn2929:  - Replaced a hardcoded colour in project's tree with a
	  system-provided one.

2006-08-31 10:17  mandrav

svn2928:  * Each of the special folders (globals) in the symbols
	  browser is coloured gray if it contains no tokens.

2006-08-31 09:45  mandrav

svn2927:  * Symbols browser now keeps the special folders with
	  globals on top, when sorting.
	  * Symbols browser doesn't display container tokens (namespaces,
	  classes, enums) in the bottom list.
	  * Fixed bug in symbols browser which would show a + in front of
	  classes even if no children (especially when option to show
	  inheritance is enabled).

2006-08-31 09:11  killerbot

svn2926:  - minor update to previous commit (better focus)

2006-08-31 07:07  killerbot

svn2925:  * CodeCompletion toolbar added which allows to jump to
	  functions of the current editor and also tracks in which function
	  your cursor is (view->toolbars->codecompletion)

2006-08-30 18:58  mandrav

svn2924:  - Removed an empty function.
	  - Added missing #include.

2006-08-30 16:29  mandrav

	  * Updated files to compile / debug
	  * Commented wxSmith internal wizard
	  * Some small cleanups

2006-08-29 11:16  tiwag

svn2920:  - windows crashhandler uses "My
	  documents\cb-crash-recover" folder
	  current editor files are saved in a subdirectory of the current
	  date & time
	  files with same name are saved with appended increasing numbers
	  e.g. main.cpp.001, main.cpp.002, ...

2006-08-29 10:33  killerbot

svn2919:  * little clean up in compilergcc and removed incorrect
	  delete at destructor

2006-08-28 17:47  mandrav

svn2918:  * Do not try to build the projects tree if the app is
	  shutting down (rare but possible crash).

svn2917:  * Added "project symbols" view filter in symbols
	  browser.

2006-08-28 09:22  mandrav

svn2914:  * Fixed small bug with preprocessor directives handling
	  in code-completion's parser.

	  commits? Parsing time has been cut down by about 50%.

2006-08-27 14:06  mandrav

svn2913:  * Improved code-completion for local scope.
	  - The code-completion parser now saves the starting and ending
	  line of a function's implementation.
	  - Fixed bug in code-completion's tokenizer when some special
	  characters were found inside comments.

2006-08-27 10:12  mandrav

svn2912:  * Improved "Go to function" internal implementation.
	  * Fixed bug in code-completion's tokenizer with preprocessor
	  directives handling.

2006-08-27 07:39  mandrav

svn2911:  * Added "Remove files" popup menu options for virtual
	  folders.

	  name hasn't been changed and avoid warning that there's another
	  virtual target with the same name.

2006-08-25 17:25  mandrav

svn2900:  * Fixed flashing code-completion list, when no entries
	  in it (would show and then hide, causing a flash).

2006-08-25 16:11  mandrav

svn2899:  * Fixed crash-bug in code-completion parser. Also
	  disabled the handling of typedefs to refine its parsing.

2006-08-25 12:28  mandrav

	  code-completion commit.

2006-08-25 11:43  killerbot

svn2896:  * codesnippets : updated cbp file (windows)

2006-08-25 10:24  mandrav

svn2895:  * Removed "No matches" tooltip when code-completion
	  contains no matches.
	  * Added matching C++ keywords in the code-completion list.

2006-08-25 09:23  mandrav

svn2894:  * Handle special keyword "this" for code-completion.

2006-08-25 08:53  mandrav

svn2893:  * Finally fixed (true!) the symbols browser weirdness.
	  A couple of missing variable initializers in constructors did all
	  the mess...
	  * Re-enabled the option of showing inherited members in the
	  symbols browser.
	  * Added handling of #if[[n]def] preprocessor blocks in
	  code-completion's parser. Currently it accepts the #if part and
	  ignores from the #el[se|if] (if it exists) up to the #endif. The
	  special case "#if 0" will be handled later.

2006-08-24 13:38  mandrav

svn2892:  * Fixed broken code-completion parsing of last few
	  days, manifested by displaying the same symbol multiple times
	  (and as a namespace) in the symbols view.

2006-08-23 18:21  killerbot

svn2891:  * Patch 1387 : OpenedFilesTree did not get updated
	  properly

2006-08-23 17:59  mandrav

svn2890:  * Disabled viewing inherited members in symbols
	  browser. Causes a stack overflow in some big projects (need to
	  investigate further).
	  * Fixed a memory leak in symbols browser.

2006-08-23 12:44  mandrav

svn2889:  * Added virtual folders support for projects.

2006-08-23 12:42  mandrav

svn2888:  * Fix (?) for recent strange behavior of symbols
	  browser.

2006-08-22 14:01  killerbot

svn2887:  * further improvements for codecompletion (local scope)
	  * removed several completion triggers (Fill Ups) (eg : ';' no
	  longer triggers the cc suggestion to be inserted)

2006-08-21 11:00  mandrav

svn2886:  * Updates for determining/handling current scope
	  namespaces in code-completion .

2006-08-21 07:18  killerbot

svn2885:  - InfoWindow : Changed _("") to _T("") because the
	  former interferes with i18n

2006-08-20 21:14  daniel2000

svn2884:  * RPM spec file: Added missing files to filelist

2006-08-20 20:21  mandrav

svn2883:  * Added preliminary support for the "using namespace"
	  directive. Works for file-scope only.

2006-08-20 10:06  mandrav

svn2882:  * Fixed bug with global user vars and paths with
	  spaces.
	  - MacrosManager::ReplaceMacros() no longer uses
	  QuoteStringIfNeeded(), because it's not its job to do it...

2006-08-20 09:13  mandrav

svn2881:  * Fixed recognition of the implementation line for a
	  function token in code-completion. Would store the function's
	  end, instead of the start.
	  * Removed option for symbols browser to dock in the project
	  management notebook. It is now a floating (and docking) window.
	  Fixes bug #8346 too.
	  * Removed false alert for reparsing projects when code-completion
	  options were changed, but no project was open.

2006-08-20 08:40  mandrav

svn2880:  * Correctly update open files list when saving an
	  editor under a different name (bug #8444, patch #1361).

2006-08-19 17:06  mandrav

svn2879:  * Updates to code-completion local scope parsing.

2006-08-19 09:21  thomasdenk

svn2876:  - Added .pot files

2006-08-18 15:24  thomasdenk

svn2875:  * Changed _("") to _T("") because the former interferes
	  with i18n
	  - Made "project format updated" message less redundant.

2006-08-18 13:15  mandrav

svn2874:  - Disabled calltips for function pointers in
	  code-completion. Leads to infinite loop in some cases.

2006-08-18 12:39  mandrav

svn2873:  * Added code-completion preliminary support for
	  typedefs:
	  "typedef struct" is not supported
	  "typedef class" is not supported
	  "typedef enum" is not supported
	  Other typedefs are supported. Yes, even function pointers.

2006-08-18 09:02  mandrav

svn2872:  * Changed default settings for code-completion parser:
	  parse local includes, global includes and preprocessor symbols
	  are enabled now. Everyone's settings will be changed to these
	  defaults.
	  - Changed code-completion plugin version number. Was unfair to
	  still be at 0.1 ;).

2006-08-18 08:16  mandrav

svn2871:  - Two new virtual targets added to CodeBlocks*.cbp:
	  "Core app & plugins" and "Third-party libs".
	  - Updated CodeBlocks*.cbp to format 1.5.

2006-08-18 08:12  mandrav

	  variables) before starting a new search.

2006-08-17 13:41  mandrav

svn2869:  * Improved function that discovers which is the
	  namespace/function code-completion kicked in.
	  - Some other minor (cosmetic) code-completion bug-fixes.

2006-08-17 09:22  mandrav

svn2868:  * Suppress multiple info windows, if bearing the same
	  message.

2006-08-17 08:48  mandrav

svn2867:  * Fixed bug introduced with virtual targets, where the
	  wrong target would build (based on the toolbar combo target
	  selection).

2006-08-17 08:45  mortenmacfly

svn2866:  - include fixes for GCC compilers not supporting PCH

2006-08-17 07:09  mandrav

svn2865:  * Fixed bug in virtual targets dialog, when trying to
	  edit the name of a virtual target and canceling the name change
	  dialog.

2006-08-16 19:29  killerbot

svn2864:  - copystrings : minor cleanup/include fix
	  - include/pch conflicts resolved

2006-08-16 13:49  mandrav

svn2863:  * Added support for virtual build targets. These are
	  user-defined aliases that group together real build targets. For
	  example, a well-known virtual target is "All". Configuration can
	  be accessed from project properties, "Targets" page, "Virtual
	  targets..." button.
	  - SDK version changed to 1.9.0.
	  - API change for cbProject::[Get|Set]ActiveBuildTarget().
	  - API rename for cbProject::[Get|Set]DefaultExecuteTargetIndex
	  (int) to cbProject::[Get|Set]DefaultExecuteTarget (wxString).

2006-08-16 12:50  mandrav

svn2862:  * Correctly update class-browser when closing a
	  project.

2006-08-16 11:35  mortenmacfly

	  under cursor in editor (on right-click in active editor)

2006-08-16 11:33  killerbot

svn2860:  * TODO plug-in : replaced combobox controls by choice
	  controls

svn2859:  * fixed some pch/include conflicts

2006-08-16 10:51  mandrav

	  must be the very first #included file...

2006-08-16 09:35  mandrav

svn2857:  - Updated unix project file.

2006-08-16 09:26  mandrav

svn2856:  - #include fix.

2006-08-16 09:24  mandrav

svn2855:  * Greatly improved/enhanced code-completion:
	  C/C++ parser is much more accurate now.
	  Code-completion proposals are much more correct, based on
	  context.
	  Functions implementation file and line are now correctly
	  identified.
	  Function arguments tooltips (a.k.a. calltips) are now updated
	  dynamically, while typing, reducing the possible matches based on
	  the number of already typed function arguments.
	  Calltips highlight the current argument (only if one matching
	  function signature because of a scintilla limitation).
	  Improved "Go to declaration/implementation" functionality when
	  right-clicking on a token in the editor.
	  * Removed old (custom) code-completion control.
	  - Built-in code-completion debugging tool for C::B developers.
	  Invoke by double-clicking any symbol in the symbols view, while
	  holding Ctrl and Shift.

2006-08-15 16:47  killerbot

2006-08-14 14:03  killerbot

svn2845:  * Tool(s) : little clean up and rename

2006-08-14 10:57  mortenmacfly

svn2844:  - added cb_coders-unix project file, updated
	  ContribPlugins-unix appropriate

2006-08-14 08:40  mandrav

svn2843:  * Forward all scintilla events to all hooked clients to
	  cbEditor (only a couple of events were forwarded).
	  - Fix for debugger plugin which was consuming the
	  EVT_EDITOR_TOOLTIP, never to be seen by other plugins.
	  * wxAUI fix for GTK crashes.
	  * wxAUI fix when loading a saved perspective and some layout
	  items do not exist anymore: the layout does not break, just
	  ignores the missing items.

2006-08-13 20:14  killerbot

svn2842:  * added horizontal scrollbar to multiselect dialog
	  (according to wx : windows only) (== [ Feature Request #2484 ]
	  Helpfull scrollbar)

2006-08-13 16:32  pecan

svn2841:  - KeyBinder v0.4.24 Reapply recursive UpdateAll() menu
	  scan removed by v0.4.20 reversion
	  - KeyBinder v0.4.24 Reapply multiple key profile update removed
	  by v0.4.20 reverson

2006-08-12 16:41  killerbot

2006-08-12 10:50  mandrav

svn2839:  - MessageManager::DebugLogWarning() and
	  MessageManager::DebugLogError() no longer popup a message box.
	  * Hide code-completion list when the editor loses focus.

2006-08-12 08:54  killerbot

svn2838:  * little include fix

2006-08-11 18:20  mortenmacfly

svn2837:  - cb_koders: another fix, restored wxSmith connectivity

2006-08-11 16:04  killerbot

svn2836:  * fix for previous commit

2006-08-11 12:03  killerbot

svn2835:  * CB_Coders :
	  - includes fixes (location and non precompiled)
	  - const methods
	  - typo
	  - add to contrib plug-ins unix workspace
	  - changed wxCombo to wxChoice (is in this case sufficient and
	  then we don't suffer the wx 2.6.2 bug on linux)

2006-08-11 09:37  mortenmacfly

svn2834:  - updated cb_koders project file to be compatible with
	  other plugins (removed Unicode suffix)

2006-08-11 09:18  mortenmacfly

svn2833:  * added cb_koders to contrib plugins (interface to
	  query the koders.com webpage)

2006-08-11 09:01  tiwag

svn2832:  * wxScintilla patched to work with NUMPAD navigation
	  keys (pageup, pagedown, ...)

2006-08-09 12:31  thomasdenk

svn2831:  Include parsing of _svn directories

2006-08-08 21:13  mandrav

svn2830:  * Made new SDL wizard cross-platform. Also changed
	  sample bitmap.
	  * Fixed wizards layout bug (would cut-off part of some controls
	  on the right side).

2006-08-08 19:44  mandrav

svn2829:  - Fixed (i.e. removed) harmless error message when
	  launching a new wizard.

2006-08-08 19:43  mortenmacfly

svn2828:  * added new SDL scripted wizard (thanks sethjackson,
	  slightly modified)

2006-08-08 12:39  mandrav

svn2827:  * Fixed crash while debugging and selecting some text.
	  Also fixes correctly the previous crash regarding debugger
	  tooltips.

2006-08-08 09:20  mandrav

svn2826:  * Fixed crash when debugger's tooltip is closed, under
	  certain circumstances.

2006-08-07 21:55  ceniza

	  * Fixed code-completion handling of arrays [].

2006-08-07 10:10  mandrav

svn2819:  * Fixed bug in global variables substitution. Wouldn't
	  substitute GVs while a project was loading, leading to wrong
	  behaviour in certain plugins (like code-completion: it wouldn't
	  parse include dirs defined using GVs).

2006-08-06 16:18  mandrav

svn2818:  * Reset wizards' script state before each run.

2006-08-06 14:50  mandrav

	  evaluation tooltips.

	  have browse button

2006-08-04 13:32  killerbot

svn2812:  * "[ Bug #8026 ] Cancel button commits the action"
	  fixed which also resulted in following fixes :
	  + all comboboxes -> choice controls
	  + reduced state
	  + current compiler : be more consistent : use the member instead
	  of each time retrieving from control
	  + project/target : be more consistent : use the members instead
	  of the tree control
	  + all settings can be cancelled out (except advanced settings and
	  compiler add/delete and autodetect)
	  + so no direct applies of several settings
	  + 3 points of save/apply (selection change/compiler
	  change/apply)user will be queried if save is needed in the first
	  2 cases
	  + some methods did not need to be member methods
	  + DoFillTree now does what it says and no other hidden loading of
	  options
	  + AutoDetectCompiler : also backup extra paths
	  + OnEditVarClick : allow that the value remains the same but the
	  key get's renamed
	  + when project changed compiler : not in all cases the user was
	  queried if the targets should change accordingly their compiler
	  and informed that it's best to rebuild the project
	  + when target changed compiler : also inform the user it's best
	  to rebuild the target (similar to project)

2006-08-03 16:50  mandrav

svn2811:  * Yet another autotools fix.

2006-08-03 16:11  mandrav

	  fixes (slightly adjusted including fix)

2006-08-02 17:06  mandrav

	  * doxygen file (sdk.doxy) updated to recent version

2006-08-02 11:50  mandrav

svn2801:  * Log some common GDB error messages in the debug log.
	  * When debugging, pointers are dereferenced for tooltips (when
	  hovering the mouse over a variable).
	  * Minor cleanup in C::B standard dirs caching.

2006-08-02 07:02  killerbot

svn2800:  * [ Patch #1262 ] Make lexer

2006-08-01 19:11  killerbot

svn2799:  * [ Patch #1259 ] Wrong path to compiler settings

2006-08-01 12:20  mandrav

svn2798:  * Added ConfigManager::GetFolder() and changed
	  signature and semantics of ConfigManager::LocateDataFile(). It
	  now takes a flags value of known dirs (as a bitmask of SearchDirs
	  enumerators) to specify where to look in. Files located in the
	  user's configuration folder (under $HOME) have precedence over
	  globally installed files.
	  * Exported the above functions to scripts as global functions.
	  * Updated critical parts of the code to use the new way to locate
	  their data files. E.g. PluginManager now looks for plugins in the
	  user's config dir too. The same goes for lexers loading as well
	  as for scripts.
	  * When editing a wizard script, it is saved in the user's config
	  dir now (where the user does have write access for sure). From
	  that point on, the specific wizard is marked in red in the "new
	  from template" dialog to signify the fact that it has been
	  customized (overriding the globally installed script).

2006-07-29 18:26  killerbot

	  file open dialog(s)

2006-07-25 14:38  mortenmacfly

svn2782:  * interprete "Cancel" as success for file extension
	  handler (thus no misleading error if user pressed Cancel in the
	  file extension handler dialog)

2006-07-25 12:14  mortenmacfly

svn2781:  * updated scriptedwizard to allow selection of more
	  than one target on FilePathPanels
	  * updated several single-file wizards to allow selection of more

	  * added "multi target selection" to common_functions script for
	  re-use

svn2776:  * debugger: made runing the debugee inside the debugger
	  optional (for remote debugging)
	  * debugger: add setup option disassembly-flavor instruction-set
	  (for e.g. ARM debugging)

2006-07-20 16:36  killerbot

svn2775:  * fixed OptionsRelationType of resource include dirs
	  (got bad values due to unintialized variable) and adjusted some
	  project files which probably had the bad setting due to the bug

2006-07-20 13:12  tiwag

svn2774:  * codeblocks app returns batch-build exit code (when
	  batch-build was active)

2006-07-19 22:45  pecan

2006-04-05 09:55  mandrav

svn2306:  * No more delays when opening "Settings->Editor" (due

svn2294:  * Improved class browser search function.

2006-04-04 08:08  mandrav

svn2293:  * Class browser searching improved: search starts at
	  the currently selected node and searches all nodes inside it. If
	  it fails, it searches the whole class browser tree. So basically,
	  pressing Enter (or clicking the search button) continuously, will
	  cycle through all the matching nodes.

	  adding/removing lines in the editor (used to keep the old

	  the file (would just focus it if it was already open).

svn2130:  * Added "Debug->Debugging windows->Examine memory". Not

svn2120:  * fixed some missing includes

2006-03-02 19:12  mandrav

	  + and the running threads

svn2096:  * Converted disassembly dialog to use wxScintilla
	  instead of a list control.
	  * Added editor lexer for MASM assembly.
	  * Changed editor lexer keywords to support up to 9 sets
	  (wxScintilla limit). <Language>, <User> and <Documentation> tags
	  in lexers are now considered obsolete (they still work though).
	  They should be replaced by <Set>. The "index" attribute defines
	  the keyword index for the set (its meaning is different on a
	  per-lexer basis).

2006-03-01 09:48  mandrav

svn2095:  * Removed hardcoding of CPU registers for debugging.
	  All available CPU registers are displayed now.

svn2040:  * Find & Replace functions bugfixes & enhancements:

	  attempt (no bogus "Result not found" )
	  - Find & FindNext (F3 & Shift-F3) are using the actual selected

	  before)

	  anymore. No more broken lexers after a new lexer is added.
	  * Fixed defining multiple syntax highlighting themes not working.
	  * Editor themes configuration saves only what's different from
	  the lexer files. This shaves off 60% of configuration size, if no
	  theme is customized. Should do the same with compilers
	  configuration some day...

2006-02-10 21:42  mandrav

svn1981:  * Fixed syntax highlighting not working for newly

2006-02-09 10:31  mandrav

svn1967:  * Refactored Compiler class to use string IDs instead
	  of numeric. No more messing up user-defined compilers. Users
	  should only re-define their user-defined compilers for the last
	  time.
	  * Debugger's debug log can now be shown/hidden without requiring
	  C::B to restart. Will implement this for other logs too.

	  active file's encoding. Partial patch by 280Z28.
	  * Added simple BOM signature encoding auto-detection on file
	  open.

	  longer exist (patch #1418161).

2006-02-02 13:39  mandrav

svn1927:  * Fixed default code for editors not being saved

svn1898:  * Fixed project tree flickering when removing single

2006-01-30 10:33  mandrav

svn1897:  * Don't add <dir>/include and <dir>/lib in GCC's
	  auto-detection code (bug #1410668).

2006-01-30 08:22  mandrav

svn1896:  * Compiler error messages now correctly open the file
	  containing the error, even if it belongs to a non-active project
	  (usually happens when building a workspace).

2006-01-30 08:08  mandrav

svn1895:  * Fixed building single file (without project) with
	  parallel build.

2006-01-30 03:35  rickg22

	  sections

2006-01-29 05:11  rickg22

svn1889:  * Fixed debugger crash when trying to edit watch in
	  watches tree.

2006-01-27 19:39  thomasdenk

svn1888:  Disabled CB_PRECOMP for compilers that don't support
	  it.
	  This should prevent old compilers from including each and every
	  SDK header for every source file when they are accidentially run
	  with precompilation turned on.
	  This also means that we can now rely on the value of CB_PRECOMP.
	  When building with a compiler that does support precompilation, a
	  good amount of headers does not need to be loaded (as the
	  preprocessor will strip them anyway).

2006-01-27 14:56  mandrav

svn1887:  * Fixed build errors for non-windows builds (by
	  DerMeister).

	  * Workspaces are now added to recent projects history again.

2006-01-27 08:24  mandrav

svn1882:  * Added priority for plugin configuration panels so
	  higher priority configuration panels appear higher in the

	  higher priority.

2006-01-27 05:29  rickg22

svn1881:  Code completion: Added missing critical section lockers
	  in parserthread.

2006-01-26 18:00  mandrav

svn1875:  * Merged ym_gdb branch to trunk.

2006-01-26 13:52  thomasdenk

svn1873:  Added new SDK event PROJECT_TARGETS_MODIFIED, fired
	  whenever a target is added, deleted or modified, or when the
	  order of targets is changed.
	  The event is caught by the compiler plugin to update the toolbar
	  target list.

2006-01-26 12:37  thomasdenk

svn1870:  Default code is properly saved now.

	  * NOTE 1: Some weird behavior when clicking Preview more than
	  once for some predefined styles (I'll just blame AStyle itself
	  for this one).
	  * NOTE 2: The new files still need to be added to the
	  Code::Blocks project file (it's beyond my powers).

	  * The debugger now has options to automatically switch layouts on
	  debugging session start/end. Configured in "Settings->Debugger".
	  * Removed $Id and $Date SVN keywords from sdk/manager.h which
	  caused a full rebuild after every commit.

2006-01-11 11:29  mandrav

svn1715:  * Fixed non-working color buttons in
	  "Settings->Environment->Appearence->Docking system".

2006-01-11 11:15  mandrav

svn1714:  * Added support for watching unicode wxString while
	  debugging :)

2006-01-11 09:17  mandrav

svn1713:  * Patched wxPropertyGrid (cyberkoa ported
	  wxAdvImageProperty from the propgrid sample).

2006-01-11 09:15  mandrav

svn1712:  * Added Manager::Yield(). Use this whenever you need to
	  call wxYield() and friends. It's safer. Updated all affected
	  code.

2006-01-11 07:19  rickg22

svn1711:  Revamped the CodeCompletion plugin, Stage 1. Reparsing
	  after saving files is much faster now. Also, the code completion
	  functionality is much faster due to the searchtree structure.
	  Known issues: The Class browser is NOT updated when using the
	  cache. WARNING: Might cause crashes if you have the cache
	  enabled. Please disable it.

svn1707:  * Fixed wxAUI linking error in wxMSW.

2006-01-10 22:32  thomasdenk

svn1706:  Manager framework redesign
	  - No more ManagerProxy
	  - Manager::Get() is a lot less expensive than it was before
	  - Manager::Get() never returns an invalid pointer, the same is
	  true for Manager::GetConfigManager.
	  - All other managers are initialised when they are first
	  referenced and deinitialised in order of dependence during
	  shutdown.
	  - The Manager::GetXXX functions will not automatically return
	  null while the application is shutting down. Instead, a valid
	  pointer is returned as long as the respective manager is
	  available, null thereafter.
	  - Plugins are freed before most core managers (for example
	  EditorManager, ProjectManager, and MessageManager) shut down, so
	  there can never be an invalid pointer for these.
	  - The status of all managers can be verified using the static
	  ManagerXXX::Valid() function.
	  - PersonalityManager correctly works for the --profile=ask option
	  now (showing a list of available profiles)

2006-01-10 22:16  mandrav

2006-01-10 14:06  mandrav

svn1701:  * Compiler errors don't highlight the whole line with
	  the ugly orange color anymore. Instead, a red mark is used in the
	  margin.
	  * Removed obsolete editor's color settings (like "compiler
	  error").
	  * Updated wxScintilla to version 1.67.

2006-01-10 09:40  mandrav

svn1700:  * Converted ToDoList from message log to docking

	  filename for opened empty files.

2006-01-09 13:49  mandrav

	  and call-stack debugger windows.

svn1689:  * All debugging windows are now kept in sync at all
	  times.
	  * Debugger commands don't get queued if the relevant debugging

	  menu entry.

2006-01-08 10:50  mandrav

svn1677:  * Keep "Start here" page in-sync with the actual

	  * Added "Recent files" in "Start here" page.

2006-01-08 09:41  mandrav

svn1676:  * All docking windows are now "named". This will fix
	  the problem of breaking saved layouts when adding new dock
	  windows with each version. Just delete your existing ones (for
	  the last time).
	  * Fixed some bugs in AnnoyingDialog.
	  * Used AnnoyingDialog for layout saving confirmation.

2006-01-08 03:52  pecan

svn1671:  * Converted debugger breakpoints dialog to docking

svn1668:  * When dragging a floating window around, if pressing
	  ALT no docking will take place.
	  * A couple of fixes to wxAUI (patch submitted to its authors).
	  * Fixed a potential crash under windows when shutting down and
	  docking windows were open. This might fix the similar problem in
	  linux but it hasn't been checked.
	  * The default view layout can no longer be deleted but rather
	  reverted to "factory defaults".
	  * Added wxAUI as a dependency of main app. This forces a re-link
	  of the app when wxAUI is rebuilt.

2006-01-07 10:29  mandrav

svn1667:  * Dummy commit to update the "Date" keyword (where do

svn1666:  * Added "Open with" menu when right-clicking a file in
	  the project tree.

svn1658:  * Fixed a build error in keybinder plugin (failed only
	  on some systems).
	  * Added -fexceptions compiler option to a couple of contrib
	  plugins. Without it, precompiled headers were not used.

2006-01-04 23:43  thomasdenk

svn1657:  Added an extra QuoteStringIfNeeded (bug 1397329).
	  Actually this is redundant, but it works this way, and doesn't
	  without.

2006-01-04 22:20  mandrav

svn1656:  * Added wxFlatNotebook in the autotools build system.

2006-01-04 20:39  ceniza

svn1655:  * Added missing -fexceptions flag to the project file
	  so it'll use the precompiled header

2006-01-04 19:58  mandrav

svn1654:  * Added wxFlatNotebook in the project (linux build
	  system *not* yet updated).
	  * Removed old code for editors close button.
	  * Added cbEVT_HIDE_DOCK_WINDOW event.
	  * EditorManager now uses wxFlatNotebook.
	  * Added wxFlatNotebook settings in environment settings dialog.

2006-01-04 09:18  thomasdenk

svn1652:  Inserted deliberate malfunction into autorevision.
	  autorevision will now continue silently in absence of revision
	  information. This defeats the purpose of revisioning, but it
	  allows to build the project from unversioned files.

2006-01-03 01:25  pecan

svn1651:  keybinder;fixed misattaches;added textCtrl attaches

2006-01-02 17:41  mandrav

2006-01-01 19:28  mandrav

svn1642:  * Re-enabled wxCheckListBox in wxSmith because it
	  wouldn't load properly (don't know why it was disabled in the
	  first place).

2006-01-01 19:23  mandrav

svn1641:  * Renamed CodeBlocks-NewBuild-UNI.cbp to
	  CodeBlocks-NewBuild.cbp

2006-01-01 19:21  mandrav

2005-12-29 15:03  mandrav

svn1614:  * Added propgrid files in CodeBlocks-unix.cbp.
	  * Fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running a program. It adds the
	  target's working directory to the runtime linker's path
	  (non-windows platforms).

2005-12-29 14:28  mandrav

svn1613:  * Fix wxSmith build using autotools.

	  wxString, bool ignoreEmpty)
	  - if ignoreEmpty is true and the value is wxEmptyString,
	  the command is not ignored, but an existing key is actually
	  *deleted*
	  - this fixes bug [1389932]
	  - it is incorrect behaviour, but it is what people *expect* to
	  happen

2005-12-27 18:22  thomasdenk

svn1604:  Another two Unicode fixes

2005-12-27 18:14  thomasdenk

	  Behold the wrath of Makefile.am :)

2005-12-27 17:31  thomasdenk

svn1602:  Slightly improved "Goto declaration" menu
	  - does not show if Token cannot be found anyway (no more
	  disturbing error message)
	  - if implementation is known, "Goto implementation" is available
	  
	  This still needs to be worked on, "Goto implementation" could be
	  shown a lot more often if the class name / namespace was looked
	  up explicitely.

2005-12-27 16:36  tiwag

svn1601:  * bugfix add standard LibDir "$(#WX.lib)\\gcc_dll"

svn1588:  * Fixed unicode bug in searchtree.cpp
	  * Optimized a bit of searchtree

2005-12-03 11:17  mandrav

svn1431:  * Moved main frame showing at the very last stage of
	  the app loading process. This speeds app startup because there's
	  no GUI visible until everything's loaded.

	  personality if no other specified.

2005-11-30 14:39  mandrav

svn1418:  * Added command line options for batch builds
	  (--hidden, --rebuild and --build). They operate on the
	  project/workspace command-line argument. Still have to save the
	  build log to a file...
	  * Fixed personalities to work again. For each personality, a
	  different .conf file is used (instead of default.conf).

2005-11-30 06:00  cyberkoa

	  * Implemented search in arbitrary paths/filemasks for
	  find-in-files.

svn0979:  * Fixed UI glitch in find-in-files (the editor that

	  EditorBase::OnAfterBuildContextMenu() which are called before and
	  after (respectively) context menu creation. Used in cbEditor to
	  move the caret to where the mouse cursor is, before creating the
	  context menu. This is because some menu entries scan the word
	  under the cursor and without this, it needed first a left click
	  on the word in interest and then a right click. Now it's done in
	  a simple right-click. This also implements RFE #1264036.

svn0977:  * Allow multiple files selection when adding link
	  libraries (rfe #1290628).

	  GetArrayFromString()
	  * Removed cbPlugin::GetSDKVersionMajor() and

	  * Added CB_DECLARE_PLUGIN() and CB_IMPLEMENT_PLUGIN(name) to ease
	  the plugin binding.
	  * Updated all plugins in CVS to use the above macros.
	  * Fixed code generated from PluginWizard to comply to the above
	  changes.

	  cbProjectWizardPlugin plugins

2005-10-04 19:02  mandrav

svn0966:  * Re-enabled inheritance calculation in code-completion
	  plugin (accidentally removed when we switched to thread pooling).

2005-10-04 09:17  mandrav

svn0965:  * Fixed bug in code-completion cache saving/loading, by
	  completely redesigning the process. No wonder why code-completion
	  didn't work for a lot of people...

svn0964:  Minor cosmetic changes in the code

2005-10-03 13:38  mandrav

svn0963:  * Fixed bug in code-completion that would clear the

	  code-completion wouldn't work for many people.
	  * Added "Find declaration of [keyword]" in editor's context menu,
	  when right-clicking a token (provided by code-completion).
	  * Added "Open #include file: [file]" in editor's context menu,
	  when right-clicking an #include line (provided by
	  code-completion).

	  * Changed Irrlicht template's category from "Multimedia" to
	  "2D/3D Graphics" to conform with the other templates conventions.

	  before RC2)

2005-09-28 13:56  mandrav

svn0941:  * Renamed debugger's "Disassembly window" to "CPU
	  window"

	  updated yet,
	  * Renamed compiler's message panes to "Build log" and "Build
	  messages"

2005-04-21 15:52  mandrav

svn0325:  * Updated XP-style-manifest location in win32 resource
	  file

2005-04-21 13:13  mandrav

2005-04-21 08:40  mandrav

svn0323:  * Fixed bug in search function

svn0321:  * Further optimized project loading (AddFile)

2005-04-21 01:31  rickg22

2005-04-20 13:17  mandrav

svn0319:  * Bug-fix in .vcproj importer: compiler search dirs
	  * Bug-fix in .dsp importer: no compiler options imported some

2005-04-20 02:34  rickg22

svn0314:  * Skipped the base path calculation if the project is
	  still loading (now does it at the end of ProjectLoader::DoUnits).
	  Still works as usual when adding the files manually.

2005-04-19 13:20  mandrav

svn0313:  * Don't default to "search in selected text" for
	  searches, when the selected text is the result of the previous
	  search (rfe #1144178)

2005-04-19 13:07  mandrav

svn0312:  * Display "text not found" message if the search failed
	  (rfe #1143936)

2005-04-19 12:35  mandrav

svn0311:  * Correct fix for unnamed-new-files in project tree

	  where the files in the tree wouldn't have names (visual glitch).

svn0308:  Removed manifest file from the output directory (it's
	  already copied by update.bat from the setup directory)

2005-04-17 14:14  rickg22

svn0307:  Fixed typo library in the wxwindows_static.cbp

svn0298:  * Removed most of the project tree flickering on
	  certain actions

2005-04-15 20:08  mandrav

svn0297:  * When "cleaning" a dynamic library target (dll), the
	  .def exports file is not deleted anymore, because it might be
	  supplied by the user (bug #1183690)

2005-04-15 16:32  mandrav

svn0296:  * Updated unix project file and Makefile.unix
	  * Updated some #includes to work in linux (quotes used instead of
	  angled
	  braces)

2005-04-15 12:01  mandrav

svn0295:  * Fixed generated Makefile to correctly create needed
	  dirs for objects and dependencies output

	  for relative files in dirs above the project file's dir

2005-04-15 02:45  rickg22

svn0294:  * Disabled Project menus (even popup menus) when
	  Project hasn't finished loading.
	  * Replaced annoying "Project files are still being loaded"
	  wxMessageBox() with a much more friendly wxBell().
	  * Fixed crash in MainFrame::OnProjectCloseProject (a "return;"
	  was missing inside the "if").

2005-04-14 12:05  mandrav

svn0293:  * Added ChooseDirectory() function in globals.cpp - use
	  this if you want a dir selector dialog
	  * Because of the above, absolute paths are now possible where a
	  path is entered (like compiler dirs, working directory, etc)
	  * Replaced all calls to other dir selector dialogs to use the new
	  ChooseDirectory()

2005-04-14 10:04  mandrav

svn0292:  * Bug-fix that, upon "Run", would try to locate the
	  executable in the working dir.

2005-04-14 09:28  mandrav

svn0291:  * Removed calls to wxSafeYield() which disabled input
	  and made the program slower (at least appeared to be)
	  * Updated project file options dialog to support multiple build
	  targets. Contribution by Tim Baker (patch #1182707)

2005-04-14 03:38  rickg22

svn0288:  Restored opening windows showing (aka flicker) so the
	  program won't seem to be slow

2005-04-13 12:37  mandrav

svn0287:  * Added "working dir" build target property (used for

	  options (bug #1181038)

2005-04-12 11:01  mandrav

svn0280:  * Global compile options (compiler/linker dirs/options)
	  are now put after the project options (bug #1180420)

2005-04-10 10:01  mandrav

svn0279:  * Updated "about" dialog (contributors part) and
	  contact email

2005-04-10 09:51  mandrav

svn0278:  * Updated dependencies generation for direct-mode,
	  using Tim Baker's patches (#1179956 and #1179950). Changes offer
	  a huge speed increase and there is no need for individual .depend
	  files anymore. One dependency file per-project is used now to
	  cache the file dependencies. The per-target dependency output
	  directory setting is now used only for "make-mode" compiling.

2005-04-10 09:07  mandrav

svn0277:  * Added separate setting for resource compiler dirs
	  * Re-arranged the compiler options dialog: merged the compiler
	  and linker dirs and added resource dirs, all in one page
	  * Added message display when the debugger isn't set and a
	  debugging session has been requested (bug #1180013)
	  * Updated win32 Makefile and project

svn0276:  + Added Tim Baker's (yet another) optimization patch
	  for directcommands.cpp
	  * Removed "Esc" accelerator key from "abort" compiler menu
	  (didn't work, anyway)

2005-04-10 02:45  rickg22

svn0275:  + Added maintenance comments and CVS ID tags to
	  directcommands.cpp

2005-04-10 02:37  rickg22

svn0274:  + Added "self" parameter to wxSafeYield for
	  messagemanager (this should allow *in theory* changing tabs. In
	  practice it doesn't work, but doesn't harm either so i'm leaving
	  it like that)
	  + Added user friendly error message to the debugger in case the
	  default debugger is not set up.
	  * Fixed display glitch in the Compiler Settings dialog (xrc).

2005-04-09 22:24  rickg22

svn0273:  To do items for beta 1.8 and above

2005-04-09 19:48  rickg22

	  settings to "Set File associations now")

2005-04-09 07:53  mandrav

	  commands-only targets

svn0268:  * Improved templates handling in class-parser

2005-04-08 05:41  rickg22

svn0267:  * Sped up (a little) project/workspace loading (less
	  flicker, etc)
	  * Added new parameter to EditorManager::Open to speed up project
	  loading (doesn't search for projectfile data anymore, since we
	  already have it)

2005-04-08 01:40  rickg22

svn0266:  * Replaced all occurrences of wxYield() with
	  wxSafeYield(). wxYield() is _NOT_ safe for critical operations
	  and may lead to unexpected crashes.

2005-04-07 13:41  mandrav

svn0265:  * Minor update to class browser to display "jump to
	  implementation" only where appropriate.
	  * Added union support in class-parser
	  * Fixed handling of nameless structs (f.e. used in unions) in
	  class-parser

2005-04-07 12:52  mandrav

svn0264:  * Added "jump to implementation" class-parser
	  functionality for the symbols tab - Needs testing.

	  declarations on a single line, e.g. "int x,y,z;" (bug #1162313)

svn0262:  * Both single and double-click on a compiler error,
	  jumps to the error line (bug #1178104)

2005-04-07 10:43  mandrav

svn0261:  * Fixed handling of unnamed enums in class-parser
	  * Corrected line number calculation for class-parser tokens (used
	  in "jump to declaration")

2005-04-07 05:47  rickg22

svn0260:  * Moved some methods of Editor Manager into the
	  protected area
	  *** Fixed thread crashing on early exit
	  (TODO: Fix project manager's freeze on early project closing)

2005-04-07 02:57  rickg22

svn0259:  + Added managed thread class for later use.

2005-04-07 02:46  rickg22

2005-04-05 10:50  mandrav

svn0251:  * Added MSVC7Loader patches contributed by Tim Baker

svn0250:  * Added configuration entry for selections in editor
	  colors configuration (RFE #1175452)

2005-03-27 17:53  rickg22

svn0236:  * Fixed bug #1167477: "Save all projects" resets the
	  workspace name

2005-03-27 07:48  rickg22

svn0235:  * Fixed bug 1167913 (cancel button on close
	  misbehavior)

2005-03-27 07:40  rickg22

svn0234:  * Fixed bug #1167913 (Save project cancel button
	  doesn't work).
	  * Also, modified the workspace/project/files closing process.
	  Before closing ANYTHING, it checks EVERYTHING for modifications

	  the state of the workspace is not modified at all.

2005-03-26 21:32  rickg22

svn0233:  "Cancel" button on close now works when project is

2005-03-06 19:08  rickg22

2005-03-05 05:24  rickg22

svn0167:  Modified to load plugins from SDK.
